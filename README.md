# Gluaymunchkin Website
A website designed using HTML and CSS, deployed on AWS and powered by Node.js as the backend. The website is dedicated to showcasing my beloved Munchkin cat, Gluay, and features a plethora of photos of him. The project demonstrates my ability to develop and deploy a full-stack web application, and my love for my pet."
